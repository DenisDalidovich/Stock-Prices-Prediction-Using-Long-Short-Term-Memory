# Stock-Prices-Prediction-Using-Long-Short-Term-Memory

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook with the code that uses the Recurrent Neural Network with three Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layers to predict the Apple and Intel stock prices. The predictions for the prices are made for the period of one year and are based solely on the historic prices for the same companies during the previous eleven years.
